# Snake Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java. The game allows the player to control a snake, guiding it to eat food items to grow longer. The player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Features
- Classic Snake Game experience
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer
